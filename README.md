Have you ever heard of the addictive cellular device gaming application called Lazor? Us too!

Have you ever used up all your hints or given up the game completely? Us too!

We created a code that solves Lazor <i> for </i> you! 

*ooh ahh*

Lazor.py takes in the configuration of a particular level, runs through potential configurations
that will provide a solution given the initial input.
